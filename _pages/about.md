### Hello! ¡Bienvenidos! 안녕하세요
Welcome to my page! My name is William Stone, hopefully you can learn a bit about me during your visit here.

I am currently a graduate research assistant under the direction of Dr. Junggab Son at Kennesaw State University in Marietta, GA working towards completing my MS in Computer Science. I started at KSU during the fall semester of 2017, seeking only a graduate certificate. Wanting to open my future to new opportunities, but unsure if returning to school was the right answer, I decided to test the waters by completing a series of catch-up equivalency courses, but being surrounded by others pursuing self-improvement is infectious and I could not shake the temptation of staying. I chose computer science because I have always been interested in the connection between things (especially those which may at-first seem unrelated) and CS finds itself woven into so many different parts of life in the modern world.

I received my BS in Biomedical Engineering at Mercer University in Macon, GA. Again, searching for a discipline that would allow me to connect disparate topics like computing and mechanical engineering, I chose BME as it was my best option (I would be lying if I didn't also say I was interested in med school) at the time as the University did not offer a program in mechatronics. After graduating, I started working for Anheuser-Busch as a quality assurance technician. I have been working there for six years, while cutting my hours there significantly over the last year to better focus my work on campus.

Moving forward, I hope to gain industry experience that will solidify what I've learned through my studies and help keep me continue to grow. Going back to my interest in connectivity, I am very interested in AI though I don't think I can do exactly what I'm looking for without more school. I would like to eventually pursue a PhD, but in the interim will focus on obtaining a position in data science or somewhere that I can expand my machine learning competency.

Outside of work and school, I enjoy learning language: I speak Spanish _decently_ (after sufficient warm up), but I understand and read much easier. I tried Japanese many years ago and Simplified Chinese more recently, but gave up before any significant skill developed. I'm hoping to learn a bit of Portuguese and maybe some Korean in my free time after graduation. I love driving and working on cars, specifically Japanese and German, though I can't say the "working on" bit applies to the latter. I am currently in the process of resto-modding my first car I bought in high school, a 1989 Nissan 240SX and have a few projects in mind for the future. I enjoy videogames even though I am playing less these days and my skill level seems to be highly correlated with time investment. I'm also getting back into hiking and being active outdoors.
