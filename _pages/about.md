Hello! ¡Bienvenidos! 안녕하세요

Welcome to my page! My name is William Stone, hopefully you can learn a bit about me during your visit here.

About Me
======
I am currently a graduate research assistant working under Dr. Junggab Son at Kennesaw State University in Marietta, GA working towards completing my MS in Computer Science. I started at KSU during the fall semester of 2017, seeking only a graduate certificate. Wanting to open my future to new opportunities, but unsure if returning to school was the right answer, I decided to test the waters by completing a series of catch-up equivalency courses, but being surrounded by others pursuing self-improvement is infectious and I could not shake the temptation of staying...

Outside of academia, I enjoy learning language: I speak Spanish _decently_ (after sufficient warm up), but I understand and read much easier. I tried Japanese many years ago and Simplified Chinese more recently, but gave up before any significant skill developed. I'm hoping to learn a bit of Portuguese and maybe some Korean in my free time after graduation. I love driving and working on cars, specifically Japanese and German, though I can't say the "working on" bit applies to the latter. I am currently in the process of resto-modding my first car I bought in high school, a 1989 Nissan 240SX and have a few projects in mind for the future. I enjoy videogames even though I am playing less these days and my skill level seems to be highly correlated with time investment. I'm also getting back into hiking and being active outdoors.
